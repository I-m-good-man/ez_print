Get Element value with minidom with Python
Ask Question

I am creating a GUI frontend for the Eve Online API in Python.
I have successfully pulled the XML data from their server.
I am trying to grab the value from a node called "name":
from xml.dom.minidom import parse
dom = parse("C:\\eve.xml")
name = dom.getElementsByTagName('name')
print name
This seems to find the node, but the output is below:
[<DOM Element: name at 0x11e6d28>]
How could I get it to print the value of the node?
* python
* dom
* minidom

It's starting to look like the answer to most "minidom" questions is "use ElementTree".

Otoh, if you learn minidom instead of ElementTree, you may take a little longer to start, but you will then be able to do exactly the same thing in practically any other programming language you know or eventually learn, and also be able to leverage many other tools. You pays your money and takes your choice.

It should just be
name[0].firstChild.nodeValue

When I do name[0].nodeValue is gives back "None", just to test I passed it name[0].nodeName and it gave me "name" which is correct. Any ideas?

What about name[0].firstChild.nodeValue ?

Just beware that you are not relying on implementation details in the xml-generator. There are no guarantees that the first child is the text node nor the only text node in any cases where there can be more than one child node.
